# CO2_Flux_Monitoring

These datasets and codes are the materials used in the study "Remote Monitoring of Volcanic Soil CO2 Flux Using Multi-Sensors Remote Sensing Data and Hierarchical Machine Learning Algorithms" by Chatterjee at al., 2021. The paper proposed a hierarchical machine learning algorithm farmework consisting of feature selection using neighborhood component analyssi, binary classification using ensemble learning, and regression model uaing ensemble of decision trees. The datasets used are a variety of remote sensing products which were used to estimate volcanic CO2 flux. The results showed that the proposed method can effecticely be used to monitor CO2 flux.

Please open the "main.m" MATLAB script, and run it. It will load/edit the data and generate models/results.
